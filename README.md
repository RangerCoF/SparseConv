# SparseConv
`MNIST` contains our code for MNIST. There are regular ConvNet and SparseConvNet. `ACC.ipynb` is for plotting how accuracy changes as sparsity increases.
`Caltech101` contains our code for Caltech 101. To accelerate training, all images are stored in RAM during training. It requires about 20 GB. `ConvNet.ipynb` and `SparseConvNet.ipynb` test accuracy on different levels of sparsity. 
`Resnet18` contains our Resnet 18 realized by ourselves and the failed sparse version.
`Blog.pdf` is our blog.
